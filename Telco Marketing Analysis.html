							<!-- <p>Recommendations:

							</p>
							<p>
								The analysis that serves as the basis of my recommendation indicates that Watershed and its client would benefit from $0.88M of increased profits during the first year, and yearly profits of $0.79M every year thereafter if my recommendation is enacted.
								The initial capital investment needed to implement my recommendation would be $0.48M.
								This analysis is based on the $0.5M limitation of cash on hand and original financial assumptions listed below.

								I have created a <a href="https://public.tableau.com/profile/i.ting.chao#!/vizhome/RealEstateManagement_15968469438390/Story1">dashboard</a> that illustrates the effects of changing these assumptions on predicted profits and required capital investment.
								If all the properties that are “more profitable” as a short-term rental are converted without financial limitations,
								the minimum additional profits the company could earn when the assumptions were modified within the ranges described above was $0.54M;
								the maximum additional profits Watershed could earn when the assumptions were modified within the ranges described above was $4.7M.
								Overall, the parameter that affected profits most was service fees plus regulatory fees.
							</p>
							<p>
								Predictive Modeling Details</br>
								I was provided with 4 types of information about short-term rentals of the same type (number of bedrooms, apartment or house, kitchen availability, unshared property) and in the same location as the company's client’s 244 properties:
								a typical short-term nightly rental rate, the corresponding occupancy rate for the property with that rental rate, the 10th percentile nightly rental rate, and the 90th percentile nightly rental rate.
								When the typical rental prices were expressed in terms of percentiles relative to properties of the same type and in the same location, but not when they were analyzed as raw dollar values. </br>
								I used the linear regression line and optimization function in Python to find the rental price and occupancy rate that would maximize the profits expected from each of the company's client’s 244 properties.
								Any optimized price below the 10th percentile rate was replaced with the 10th percentile rate, and any optimized price above the 90th percentile rate was replaced with the 90th percentile rate,
								in order to account for lack of data outside of these ranges in the linear model.
								These optimized rental rates were entered into a financial cash flow and profit model that computed the expected revenue from each property based on its projected occupancy rate,
								and the expected costs according to the financial assumptions described above.
